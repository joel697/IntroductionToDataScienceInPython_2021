## **Introduction To Data Science In Python 2021**
Files and programming assingments from University of Michigan Coursera's course: Introduction to Data Science in Python.
I have Decided to create this repository because the last assingment wasn't avaible in the internet and the test may have some difficult parts.


*WEEK* | *GRADES*
